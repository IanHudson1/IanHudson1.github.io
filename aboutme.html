<p>Current junior at Cal Poly Pomona majoring in mechanical engineering. I'm currently the Construction Chair in the Cal Poly Rose Float Program, leading the design 
  of mechatronic systems for the college's Rose Parade float entry. With five additional years of robotics experience, three in leadership positions, 
  I've experienced many of the project oriented and design skills needed in the field of engineering.  
</p>
<p>I also participate in Cal Poly Rose Float as a mechanical and design lead, creating moving elements and structural elements for Cal Poly's Rose Float.
